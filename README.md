Rosary is a gothic isometric roguelike narrative dungeon crawler where a girl named Rosy seeks vengeance upon a religious order, “The Hands of the Allfather”, for burning her family at the stake due to supposed witchcraft. Possessed by Surtan, a powerful demonic entity, Rosy is compelled by the whispers in her mind to fight her way through the Temple of the Allfather to reach the Divine Gate, which Surtan has told her lies within the Inner Sanctum. There, she believes she can release Surtan’s full form to wreak havoc upon those that slew her family.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rosary's gameplay revolves around fast-paced combat and strategic exploration. The game features randomly generated levels that change with each playthrough, making each run a unique experience. The enemies in the game use a detection cone system to track the player and will either follow or attack them depending on their proximity. The player must avoid contact with enemies as even a single touch results in instant death.

The game's level design is intricately crafted to create an immersive gothic atmosphere. The Temporal Garden is overgrown with vegetation and ruins, creating an eerie ambiance. The Halls of Verity are ornately carved and protected by holy knights and zealots. The Inner Sanctum is the final chamber, guarded by clerics and priests, leading up to the Divine Gate. Each area is designed to reflect the religious order's beliefs and practices, creating a coherent and immersive world.

Project Goal: The primary goal of Rosary was to create an engaging and immersive gaming experience that blended roguelike gameplay with a compelling narrative. The team aimed to develop a game that was challenging and rewarding to play, with an intricate level design and unique dual personality system.
